Among all of the file I handed in:

Four .csv files with '_cleaned' are the four data set from Homework 4 after data cleaning(there are 5 data set in HW4, and in the final project only use 4 of them).

whole_dataset.csv is the data set after combination of the above four.

Final_Project_Report_Enhao_Wang.pdf is the report of my final project, including all the required text content and plots I drew.

Final_Project_Enhao_Wang.ipynb is the code file of my final project, including all the code and plots I drew. I used markdown cells and comment to explain the code.

The four .html files are map files that I drew for visualization.

UPC_Patrol_Boundaries.geojson is the GeoJSON file I obtained from USC website, based on it I can use python package 'folium' to draw the USC DPS zone in a map.

I added some links that can open the data set(whole_dataset.csv) and map files(four .html files) in the report for convenience to grader to open them. But in my computer, these links only work on Adobe Acrobat Reader, doesn't work on browsers(I tried Edge and Chrome, both don't work). Also, to make the links work, the report file and the five referenced files should be in the same path in the computer.
